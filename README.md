# Python-Programming

## Project Overview:

As someone who has worked on the Introduction to Computer Programming project, I've delved into fundamental programming concepts using Python. This assessment covers a range of topics, including data types, indexing, slicing, operators, in-built functions, statements, conditionals, loops, object-oriented programming, and exception handling. Additionally, I've demonstrated proficiency in creating custom functions and handling advanced looping concepts.

## Key Skills Utilized:

Throughout the project, I've applied my proficiency in Python programming language and demonstrated an understanding of various concepts such as data types, indexing, slicing, operators, in-built functions, methods, statements, conditionals, loops, and iterations. I've also showcased my competence in advanced looping concepts, object-oriented programming (OOPs) principles, and handling exceptions in code.
